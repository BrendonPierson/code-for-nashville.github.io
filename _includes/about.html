##About Code For Nashville

Code for Nashville was formed in August 2014 to revitalize Nashville's [Code for America Brigade][cfa]. We are volunteers who collaborate with Metro government to promote [open data] and build [civic apps].

We are a growing organization and need members with all types of skills. If you are interested, there are [leadership roles] available.

The best way to become involved is to attend our next [hack night] and join our [google group].
