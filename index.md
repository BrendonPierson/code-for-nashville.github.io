Code for Nashville is Nashville's new [Code for America Brigade][cfa]. The Code for America Brigade program is an international network of people committed to using their voices and hands, in collaboration with local governments, to make their cities better.

We meet monthly at the Sevier Park Community Center to hack on civic projects. Check [meetup] to see when the next one is and come join us!
